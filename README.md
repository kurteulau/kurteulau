Hi, I’m @kurteulau. I'm currently a graduate student in the Master's of Information and Data Science program at UC Berkeley.
Before becoming passionate about data science I was a UC Berkeley undergraduate student then a Peace Corps Volunteer in Cambodia. Upon returning to the US I taught math and computer science in Title I public schools in New York City and California for seven years. Teaching math and computer science motivated me to dive into the nexus of those two disciplines: data science. You can now find me making a difference by taking complex systems and producing understandable insights.
