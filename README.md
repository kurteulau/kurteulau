Hi, I’m @kurteulau. I'm currently a graduate student in the Master's of Information and Data Science program at UC Berkeley.
Before becoming passionate about data science I was a UC Berkeley undergraduate student then a Peace Corps Volunteer in Cambodia. Upon returning to the US I taught math and computer science in Title I public schools in New York City and California for seven years. Teaching computer science motivated me to dive deeper in the subject. You can now find me learning new skills, surfing when I can, and applying to jobs as I transition from teaching to data science.
