Hi, I’m @kurteulau. I'm currently a graduate student in the Master's of Information and Data Science program at UC Berkeley.
Before becoming interested in data science I was a Peace Corps Volunteer in Cambodia. Upon returning to the US I taught math
and computer science in Title I public schools in New York City and California for seven years. Teaching computer science motivated me to dive deeper in the subject. You can now find me learning new packages in Python and R, building a portfolio
of data science projects, and applying to jobs as I transition from developing young humans to developing analytical models.
